## Introduction

I'm creating a new readme. The original readme can be found [here](https://github.com/ataylor89/portfolio/blob/main/original_readme.md).

The original readme has copious notes, which is a good thing, because it's very educational.

I wanted the new readme to be more concise. To keep it more concise, I might stick to 2-3 bullet points per project, at maximum.

Also, I wanted to add additional projects (more than the ten projects listed in the original readme).

I think that I will continually update this portfolio, over time, with new projects that I want to add to the list.

Now, in the spirit of brevity, let's begin.

In the next section, I will list some of the topics that are covered by the projects in the portfolio.

In the section after that, I will present my portfolio, as a list of projects.

## Topics

The topics covered by the projects in this portfolio include:

1. Web frameworks (Flask, Spring Boot)
2. GUI frameworks (tkinter, Swing)
3. Cryptography (RSA, XOR, ROT13, ROT88)
4. Password hashing and password salting (SHA256, MD5)
5. Data structures and algorithms
6. Socket programming
7. The TCP/IP protocol stack
8. REST APIs
9. Design patterns (model-view-controller, model-view-template)
10. Command-line argument parsing (e.g. by means of Python's argparse module)
11. Object serialization and deserialization (e.g. by means of Python's pickle module)
12. ASCII, Unicode, character encoding
13. Multithreading (e.g. the chat server makes use of multithreading)
14. Graphics (e.g. the Paint project does a lot with graphics)
15. Assembly language (e.g. the signal project involves x86 assembly and arm64 assembly)
16. Object oriented programming
17. Modular design
18. Web design and web applications (e.g. the homepage and jhomepage projects)
19. Desktop software (e.g. the chat, Paint, and wordprocessor projects)
20. Boolean logic, byte arithmetic, bit arithmetic
21. Variables
22. Loops, branching, control flow
23. Recursion
24. Functions
25. Objects
26. Classes
27. Databases
28. Cloud computing (AWS)
29. HTTP (GET, POST, request/response, etc)
30. Shell scripting, shell directives, symbolic links, the PATH variable, Bash, Zsh, Terminal

I wanted to present these topics, before presenting the portfolio, because it's helpful to enumerate different topics in computer science.

Let's move onto the portfolio.

## Portfolio

Here is my software portfolio, organized as a list of projects.

1. [homepage](https://github.com/ataylor89/homepage)
    - A web application written in Python using the Flask framework
2. [jhomepage](https://github.com/ataylor89/jhomepage)
    - A web application written in Java using the Spring Boot framework
3. [chat](https://github.com/ataylor89/chat)
    - A chat client and chat server written in Python
    - Encrypts messages using the RSA algorithm, and hashes passwords using the SHA256 algorithm
    - Uses a custom protocol (built on top of TCP) as well as custom packets
4. [Paint](https://github.com/ataylor89/Paint)
    - A drawing and painting application written in Java using the Swing framework
5. [WordProcessor](https://github.com/ataylor89/WordProcessor)
    - A word processor written in Java using the Swing framework
6. [signal](https://github.com/ataylor89/signal)
    - A suite of signaling programs (sigstart, sigstop, sigterm) written in C and assembly
7. [rsa](https://github.com/ataylor89/rsa)
    - An implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm
8. [xor](https://github.com/ataylor89/xor)
    - An implementation of the XOR encryption algorithm
9. [rot13](https://github.com/ataylor89/rot13)
    - An implementation of the rot13 rotation cipher
10. [rot88](https://github.com/ataylor89/rot88)
    - An implementation of the rot88 rotation cipher
11. [md5](https://github.com/ataylor89/md5)
    - An implementation of the MD5 hashing algorithm
12. [sha256](https://github.com/ataylor89/sha256)
    - An implementation of the SHA256 hashing algorithm
13. [calculator](https://github.com/ataylor89/calculator)
    - A calculator, written in Python, that evaluates arithmetic expressions (like "1 + 2 * 3")
    - It's hard to find a good use case for stacks... strategy2.py and strategy3.py give us a use case for stacks
    - The first strategy uses recursion; the second and third strategies use stacks and iteration
